# netaddr
I originally created this package back in 2007 out of the need for a tool
which I could use to track an inventory of constantly changing IP subnets.
At the time, I was in the process of migrating away from Perl and towards Ruby
as my primary scripting language. I have since migrated away from using Ruby so
I have not made any major modifications to this code base since 2008 (aside from a 
handful of bug fixes that others have pointed out).
